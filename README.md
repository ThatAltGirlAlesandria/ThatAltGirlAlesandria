# Hello ðŸ‘‹ I am Alesandria Wild (she/her/hers) 

### My Education:

##### I just completed a Full-Stack Bootcamp at Epicodus where I learned HTML, CSS, BootStrap, and JavaScript, .NODE, C#, .NET, MySQL, React, and Redux. Outside of Epicodus I am working on my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Oregon State University where I have also utilized C, C++, and Python. I have had the privilege of having an internship with a company that allowed me to learn two separate game engines Excalibur and PyGame.

### My Interests:

#### If you ever talk to me whether it be in person or virtually you will hear a lot about my animals. I could talk about them all day every day. At the beginning of the pandemic I was trying to figure out more things I could do at home, so I decided to get into the expensive hobby of Legos! But not just any legos, no, no. Custom sets that you buy from people who are certified through Lego. During the pandemic, I also got back into gaming. I game fairly frequently now and stream some of my sessions. It has been a lot of fun for me to learn how to stream and experiment with my sessions and what I stream. Some other interests I have are:

* Reading Academic articles.
* Reading Fantasy books.
* Reading Manga/Mangwa.
* Watching Anime.
* Watching live-action adaptations of books I like.
* Cooking/Baking.
* Tabletop games (i.e. Magic The Gathering, Mansion of Madness, Dungeons & Dragons, etc...) with friends.
* Learning German (or at lest attempting to).
* Broadening my dev languages (i.e. Type Script, Vue.js, etc...).
* Continuing to work on unfinished projects or updating them.
